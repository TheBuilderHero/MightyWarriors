	Races
    		Each will have a passive strength and later we will add active ability (because of this it is okay if the stats are not all the same because the plan would be that the ability makes up for that difference)

        	Human 
			- stats:
				health - 100
				armor - 10
				Magic Resistance - 5
				Magic Damage - 1
   				Agility - 10
    			Physical Damage - 5
    			Stealth - 5

        	Elf 
			- Stats:
				baseHealth - 100
    			Armor - 5
    			Magic Resistance - 10
   				Magic Damage - 15
    			Agility - 25
    			Physical Damage - 5
    			Stealth - 10

        	Dino 
			- Stats:

    			Physical Damage - 5
    			Stealth - 30

	Kits
        	Tank 	
			- axe with armor and maybe more health  (What do these stats look like?)
        	Assasin
			- very sharp short sword with less armor(What do these stats look like?)
        	Archer
			- a bow with light armor - maybe more then the assasin though (What do these stats look like?)
			
		Wizard? Is there magic?
		Ninja - Ranged assassin? Poison attacks, dodging, but very low health?
		Maybe tank has two varieties, like a gladiator with lots of health but low armor 
			and a paladin or something with normal health and very high armor
		Engineer - gets bonuses to crafting but everything else is average

    	Weapon moding
        	Make it so that we can make weapons able to created
			-We should also be able to destroy weapons that are owned for a chance to get meterials out of them.
				-this should not be a garenteed chance.
        	weapons given different meterials will give then different stats (e.g. iron = damage, wood = defense, mana gem purity = ability, rabbit foot = agility, Pomagranite (Pom Fruit) = health)
			-I think wood should be for both magic resistance and armor.

    	XP Level 
        	Start at level 1 exponential increase of experience needed to level up.
			-determine the equation we will use for this.
            	For leveling you get to pick stats for each level
			-just 1 or should this change over time?
			
		- A solid experience equation is 1000*level. But it just needs to scale with the experience you get. 
		How many monsters killed, traps disarmed, items crafted before level up?
		- Stat points should increase every few levels. E.g. level 1-5, +1 stat point; level 6-10, +2 stat points.
		Otherwise getting to a very high level only makes you a tiny bit more powerful (like 100 damage leveling up to 101)

The main TASKS that we need right now are: 
Character creation during account creation (e.g. the race and kit)
Player class (which will hold info like race, weapons, and more- this is currently in progress)
Kit classes (what weapons and armor and such)
Enemy class (who the player is gonna fight)
Battle class (which will include the function for fighting the monster)

Stats, Names, Weapon info, and other item and enemy related information. - Dominic

There are probably more.  But those are what I have on my mind right now.

I just added some initial ideas. Feel free to delete them if they're offensive lol - - - Richard
